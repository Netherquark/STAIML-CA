Question 3                               PowerBI-based programming
  (a)        Given a dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/milanzdravkovic/pharma-
             sales-data)
             The dataset is built from the initial dataset consisted of 600000 transactional
             data collected in 6 years (period 2014-2019), indicating date and time of sale,
             pharmaceutical drug brand name and sold quantity, exported from Point-of-Sale
             system in the individual pharmacy. Selected group of drugs from the dataset (57
             drugs) is classified to the following Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)
             Classification System categories:

            M01AB - Anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids, Acetic
             acid derivatives and related substances
            M01AE - Anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids, Propionic
             acid derivatives
            N02BA - Other analgesics and antipyretics, Salicylic acid and derivatives
            N02BE/B - Other analgesics and antipyretics, Pyrazolones and Anilides
            N05B - Psycholeptics drugs, Anxiolytic drugs
            N05C - Psycholeptics drugs, Hypnotics and sedatives drugs
            R03 - Drugs for obstructive airway diseases
            R06 - Antihistamines for systemic use
             Sales data are resampled to the hourly, daily, weekly and monthly periods. Data
             is already pre-processed, where processing included outlier detection and
             treatment and missing data imputation.
