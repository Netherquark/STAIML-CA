Question 1                                  R-based programming
   (a)       Consider a time-series dataset from link and create a R function that returns    CO 1
             the following
             (a) Mean
             (b) Median
             (c) Std Deviation
             (d) Variance
             (e) Skewness and Kurtosis
             (f) Histogram
             (g) Scatter plot
             (h) Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4
             (i) Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient
             (j) Box plot
   (b)       Convert the above calculated results in form a dataframe for all possible        CO 2
             numeric attributes of the dataset thereof.
   (c)       Demonstrate and explain the logical reasoning behind the working of for-loop
             and while loop in R with a suitable example.
   (d)       Consider a time-series dataset from link and do as directed
             (i) Calculate the correlation coefficient between two continuous variables.
             (ii) Determine whether the correlation is statistically significant.
             (iii) Visualize the relationship between variables using a scatter plot.
